“GOD’s EYE- EYEWITNESS RENDERED FACIAL DEPICTION AND RECOGNITION" ------ #Abstract: In this modern age, the overall crime rate is in- creasing day-by-day and to cope up with this the law enforcement departments too should find ways that would speed up the overall process and help them in bringing one to justice.  One such way can be using face recognition technology for identifying and verifying the criminal. The traditional approach here is to use the hand-drawn face sketches drawn by forensic sketch artist to identify the criminal, modernizing this would mean using the hand-drawn sketch and then matching them with the law enforcement departments database to identify the criminal. Using this approach would result in the various limitations with latest technologies and even would be time consuming as there are very few forensic sketch artists available when compared to the increasing crime ratio. Our project is aimed on decreasing the time span and speeding up this process  by  providing  a  standalone  platform  to  the  law enforcement department which would allow users to create accurate face sketch of the suspect without the help of forensic sketch artist and no special training or artistic skills. The sketch can be created using drag and drop feature in the application with variety of face elements and can automatically match the drawn composite face sketch with the law enforcement department’s database much faster and efficiently using deep learning and cloud infrastructure. --- #*INTRODUCTION*: A criminal can be easily identified and brought to justice using a face sketch drawn based on the description been provided by the eyewitness, however in this world of modernization the traditional way of hand drawing a sketch is not found to be that effective and time saving when used for matching and identifying from the already available database or real-time databases. During the past there were several techniques been proposed to convert hand-drawn face sketches and use them to automatically identify and recognize the suspect from the police database, but these techniques could not provide the desired precise results. Application to create a composite face sketch were even introduced which too had various limitations like limited facial features kit, cartoonist feel to the created suspect face which made it much harder to use these applications and get the desired results and efficiency. The above applications and needs motivated us into thinking of creating an application which would not just provide a set of individual features like eyes, ears, mouth, etc. to be selected to create a face sketch but also would allow user to upload hand- drawn individual features on the platform which would then be converted into the applications component set. This in turn would make the created sketch much more like the hand-drawn sketch and would be much easier for the law enforcement departments to adapt the application. Our application would even allow the law enforcement team to upload a previous hand-drawn sketch in order to use the platform to identify and recognize the suspect using the much more efficient deep learning algorithm and cloud infrastructure provided by the application. The machine learning algorithm would learn from the sketches and the database to suggest the user all the relatable facial features that could be used with a single selected feature in order the decrease the time frame and increase the efficiency of the platform. --- #Problem Statement*: In this modern age, the overall crime rate is increasing day-by-day and to cope up with this the law enforcement departments too should find ways that would speed up the overall process and help them in bringing one to justice.  One such way can be using face recognition technology for identifying and verifying the criminal. The traditional approach here is to use  the  hand-drawn  face sketches drawn by forensic sketch artist to identify the criminal, modernizing this would mean using the hand-drawn sketch and then matching them with the law enforcement departments database to identify the criminal. Using this approach would result in the various limitations with latest technologies and even would be time consuming as there are very few forensic sketch artists available when compared to the increasing crime ratio. Thus, there is a need for creating an application which would not just provide a set of individual features like eyes, ears, mouth, etc. to be selected to create a face sketch that would help in finding the criminal much faster and efficiently. --- #*Motivation*: The motivation behind undertaking the project "Eyewitness- Rendered Facial Depiction and Recognition" is rooted in the critical intersection of artistry, technology, and the pursuit of justice. In forensic investigations, the ability to construct accurate facial sketches plays a pivotal role in aiding law enforcement in identifying and apprehending individuals involved in criminal activities. Traditional methods often rely on witness descriptions, which can be subjective and prone to inaccuracies. --- #*Aim*: The primary aim of the "Eyewitness-Rendered Facial Depiction and Recognition" project is to develop an integrated system that combines artistic facial sketch construction with advanced recognition algorithms. This system aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of forensic investigations, pro- viding law enforcement agencies with a powerful tool for identifying and apprehending individuals involved in criminal activities. --- #*Goals*: 1.5.1 Achieve High Accuracy: Aim for a facial recognition accuracy rate that surpasses current industry standards, reducing false positives and negatives in identification. 1.5.2User-Friendly Interface: Design an interface that is intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible to both artistic professionals and law enforcement personnel with varying levels of technical expertise. 1.5.3 Real-world Applicability: Ensure that the developed system is applicable in real-world forensic scenarios, contributing to the successful resolution of criminal cases. 1.6.4 Contribution to Forensic Science: Make a significant contribution to the field of forensic science by providing law enforcement agencies with an advanced and reliable tool for facial identification --- #*GUI* : --- ![login_screen_](https://github.com/pratikshinde85/godsEye1/assets/92982632/941ff727-140a-4fe8-a0ad-0a4da33eb07c) ![menu_screen](https://github.com/pratikshinde85/godsEye1/assets/92982632/48a6c02f-5f54-4cda-bc43-d5459ffc114c)
